You can add songs by inputting the song's title, tempo, mood, and length.<br>
With the songs you add, you can create a playlist that matches the tempo and mood you want.<br>
When creating a playlist, a maximum amount of time is entered, and the greedy algorithm was used to create a playlist that does not exceed that time.

1. Enter the title of the song, enter the tempo and mood as numbers 1 to 5, and enter the time in a format such as 3 30.<br>
2. Press the Add Song button and continue adding new songs in the same way. <br>
3. Enter the tempo and mood of the desired playlist with numbers 1 to 5 and press the song sort button to create the playlist.

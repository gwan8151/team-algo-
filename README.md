#####You can add songs by inputting the song's title, tempo, mood, and length.

With the songs you add, you can create a playlist that matches the tempo and mood you want. 
When creating a playlist, a maximum amount of time is entered, and the greedy algorithm was used to create a playlist that does not exceed that time.

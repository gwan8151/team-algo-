You can add songs by inputting the song's title, tempo, mood, and length.<br>
With the songs you add, you can create a playlist that matches the tempo and mood you want.<br>
When creating a playlist, a maximum amount of time is entered, and the greedy algorithm was used to create a playlist that does not exceed that time.

1. Enter the title of the song, enter the tempo and atmosphere in numbers 1 to 5, and enter the time in the same format as 330.<br>
2. Press the Add Song button and continue to add new songs in the same way.<br>
3. Enter the tempo and atmosphere of the desired playlist in numbers 1 to 5 and press the song sort button to create a playlist.
